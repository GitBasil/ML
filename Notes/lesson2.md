## dependent vs independent

```
y = 2x + 5

x is the independent variable
y is the dependent variable
y = 2x + 5 is a linear equation
if x = 2 then y = 9
```

the concept of regression is to drive this equation from the data in order to predict the unseen data

## linear regression vs Polynomial Regression

**linear regression**: the features are coming from the dataset except for the bias features
**Polynomial Regression**: we add more features as demanded to the power of the degree we choose, ex. if the degree is 4 then you need to add 3 more features which is the x^2,x^3,x^4
