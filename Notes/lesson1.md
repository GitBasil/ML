## instance based learning vs model based learning

- Instance based: is like face detection to unlock your mobile, it remember your face and compare it with the face in the camera
- Model based: is a general detection like a security camera or safety camera

## The data set is dived into 3 types:

- training dataset: what you train the model on
- validation dataset: validate the training results to choose the best model
- testing dataset: test the chosen model and see how it perform on unseen data.

## Over-Fitting issue:

- complex (over-fitting) vs simple
- clean data
- irrelevant features
